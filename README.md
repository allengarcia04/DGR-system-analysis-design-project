# Doing Good Rewards - Business and System Analysis Project

## Background
**Doing Good Rewards** is a non-profit organization with a mission to contribute $200 million to charities by 2026. The organization aims to make charitable giving convenient, automatic, and habitual. By combining shopping discounts and charitable donations in the same transaction, Doing Good Rewards helps charities reduce the effort and funds spent on fundraising, allowing them to focus on their core mission.

The organization believes in creating a steady, reliable flow of donations rather than relying on sporadic campaigns. Through their loyalty program, Doing Good Rewards empowers individuals, businesses, and charities to make a lasting social impact with minimal effort, fostering a culture of generosity and social responsibility.


## Project Overview
This repository contains the business analysis and system analysis design work for the "Doing Good Rewards" project, a non-profit organization dedicated to rewarding good deeds in the community. The project involved identifying functional and non-functional requirements, creating data flow diagrams (DFDs), use case diagrams, and designing the UI/UX for their website.

As a volunteer for Doing Good Rewards, I contributed to the project by assisting with business and system analysis and developing essential design elements to improve the functionality and user experience of their platform.
